Quick notes:

If you instantiate an object and want to access a method or property of it, you use the '.'.

CMyObject myObj();
myObj.MethodCall();

If you have a pointer to an object and want to access a method or property of it, you use the '->'.

CMyObject *myObj = new CMyObject();
myObj->MethodCall();

If you are accessing a static method or property in some namespace, you use the '::'.

class CMyObject
{
static int MethodTwo() { cout << "Hello\n"; }
}

CMyObject::MethodTwo();

The '::' is a namespace resolution.
